1. What are Promises in JavaScript?
A Promise is an object that represents the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation. It can be in three state: pending, fulfilled or rejected.

2. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a way of writing programs by organizing code into objects that represent real-world entities. Each object contains data (attributes) and functions (methods) that define its behavior.
This approach makes programs easier to understand, reuse, maintain, and scale.

3. What are the pillars of OOP?
The four main pillars of OOP are:

Encapsulation – Bundling data and methods together and controlling access

Abstraction – Hiding complex details and showing only what’s necessary

Inheritance – Creating new classes from existing ones

Polymorphism – One interface, many implementations


4. What is async/await in JavaScript?
async/await is a syntax that allows you to write asynchronous code that looks synchronous, making it easier to read and debug. async makes a function return a promise while await pauses execution until the promise resolves
